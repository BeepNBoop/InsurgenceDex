# Hazards

Hazards are a set of moves that affect Pokemon as they switch into battle, including [[Spikes]], [[Stealth Rock]], [[Sticky Web]], [[Toxic Spikes]], [[Livewire]], and [[Permafrost]]. They are set up on the opposing side of the field when used, and can be removed when a Pokemon on that side uses [[Defog]] or [[Rapid Spin]], or is hit by Defog. Toxic Spikes can be removed when a [[grounded]] [[Poison]]-type Pokemon switches in on the affected side. Livewire can be removed when a [[grounded]] [[Electric]]-type or [[Ground]]-type Pokemon switches in on the affected side. Permafrost can be removed when a [[grounded]] [[Ice]]-type or [[Fire]]-type Pokemon switches in on the affected side.
